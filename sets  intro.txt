#set can be immutable 
#A set is an unordered collection of elements
#set removing duplicates from a sequence
#set perform union,intersection ,membership opertaions

Like other collections, sets support x in set, len(set), and for x in set. Being an unordered collection, 
sets do not record element position or order of insertion. 
#Accordingly, sets do not support indexing, slicing, or other sequence-like behavior.
